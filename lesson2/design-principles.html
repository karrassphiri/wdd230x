        The site focuses on the sliding photos which contains hyperlinks 
        to take the user to the page. On the header, The donate and give monthly 
        buttons have been included to signify their prime importance for the organisation.

      <p>
        The Donate and Give monthly buttons have been placed at the header and
        below the home page slide images. This shows repeatition and is one way to 
        make website users see what they might have missed on another part of the website.

      <h2> White space and clean design</h2>

      <p>
        There is enough white space between different sections on the home page.
        It is easy to find what one is looking for on the page because of the white spaces that have been
        placed which is making the website look clean.
